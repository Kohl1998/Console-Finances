# Console Finances

## Description

For this application I calculated a company's financial records using the programming language Javascript. 

I used variables to store data, & arithmetic comparisons to perform calculations. Furthermore, I used indices to access specific values. However, before trackling this task I used pseudocode to give me some direction. 

Lastly, once I had all the relevant information I logged the data to the console in the browser. 

During the process of building this application I learnt how important it is to become resourceful with peers, & Google when you find yourself struggling to come up with solutions. Also, I realised how important computational thinking is, as I was able to recognise recurring patterns. 

## Installation

I setup a remote repo on Github to work from, which I then cloned to my local repository so I can have the two in sync. 

Afterwards, I used vscode which is an integrated development environment which allowed me to update the software code, but also see the code in action using the live server extension. 

Lastly, once I was done I pushed all the updates to my remote repository from my local repo using commits, and once I was happy I deployed the changes to the live website.

## Features

For this application the financial records can be viewed using a browser such as Google chrome or even Microsoft edge. 

To access the information, right click on a mouse if you are using a PC or press the touchpad on a laptop. Once you do this, you will see an option at the bottom with 'inspect'. 

Click this option and then look at the top of the HTML file, and you will see a symbol with '>>', which will have the option 'console'. Click this and you will find the information.
